#### Breaking Changes

* Since the bot now integrates with checks, it requires read permissions for it ([#3](https://github.com/nikku/merge-me/issues/3)).
* In the absence of branch protection the default amount of reviews required before a pull request is merged is now one, independent of the source of the pull request ([#4](https://github.com/nikku/merge-me/issues/4)).
